# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Testing Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create complete test suite with unit, integration, security, and performance tests plus automated CI/CD pipeline
# Details:
Develop comprehensive testing framework: unit tests for all core functionality using pytest, integration tests for tool interactions, security/penetration testing suite, performance benchmarks and load testing, user acceptance test protocols, automated CI/CD pipeline with test coverage reporting, and cross-platform compatibility validation for Python 3.8+ on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

# Architecture Reference:
See tasks/architecture/arch_012.md for detailed implementation guidance.

# Test Strategy:
Multi-layered testing approach with pytest framework, security scanning tools, performance profiling, automated cross-platform testing in CI/CD pipeline, and test coverage validation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Unit Test Suite with Pytest Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up comprehensive unit test suite using pytest with proper configuration, fixtures, and test discovery for all core modules
### Details:
Create pytest.ini configuration, test fixtures for mocking API calls and file operations, unit tests for agent.py, config.py, tools.py, slash_commands.py, and main.py with proper test isolation and coverage reporting

## 2. Integration Test Scenarios for Tool Interactions [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop integration tests that verify tool interactions, permission systems, and end-to-end workflows
### Details:
Create integration tests for file editing workflows, bash command execution with permission checks, MCP server integration, slash command processing, and configuration management across user/project levels

## 3. Security Testing Automation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Implement automated security testing for command injection prevention, permission bypasses, and API key handling
### Details:
Create security test suite covering command injection attempts, permission system bypass attempts, secure API key storage validation, file path traversal prevention, and MCP server security boundaries

## 4. Performance Benchmarking Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop performance benchmarking suite to measure response times, memory usage, and API call efficiency
### Details:
Create benchmarking tests for agent response times, memory consumption during long conversations, file operation performance, MCP server communication latency, and API rate limiting behavior

## 5. CI/CD Pipeline Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4
### Description: Configure automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for testing, linting, and deployment workflows
### Details:
Set up GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing on push/PR, code quality checks with linting and type checking, security scanning, performance regression detection, and automated package publishing

## 6. Cross-Platform Compatibility Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.5
### Description: Ensure and validate cross-platform compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments
### Details:
Create platform-specific test scenarios, validate file path handling across OS types, test bash command execution on different shells, verify MCP server communication across platforms, and document platform-specific installation requirements
