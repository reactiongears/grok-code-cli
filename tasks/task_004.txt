# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Development Workflow Tools
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Add essential development tools including test execution, code linting, git operations, and dependency management
# Details:
Implement development toolset: run_tests with framework auto-detection (pytest, unittest, jest, etc.), lint_code with multiple linter support, git_operations (status, diff, commit, push, pull), install_dependencies with package manager detection (pip, npm, yarn, etc.). Provide unified interface for different frameworks with proper error handling and user feedback.

# Architecture Reference:
See tasks/architecture/arch_004.md for detailed implementation guidance.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests with real projects using different frameworks, test framework detection accuracy, git operation validation, dependency installation verification

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement run_tests with framework auto-detection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a test runner that automatically detects and executes tests using pytest, unittest, jest, and other common testing frameworks
### Details:
Build framework detection logic by checking for config files (pytest.ini, jest.config.js, etc.), package.json scripts, and file patterns. Implement unified test execution with proper output parsing and result reporting.

## 2. Create lint_code with multiple linter support [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a code linting tool that supports multiple linters like pylint, flake8, eslint, and provides unified output formatting
### Details:
Implement linter auto-detection based on project structure and config files. Create standardized output format for different linter results. Add configuration file discovery and custom rule support.

## 3. Build git_operations suite [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive git operations including status, diff, commit, push, pull with proper error handling and user feedback
### Details:
Implement git command wrappers with proper error handling, status checking, and user prompts. Add support for common workflows like staged changes, branch management, and remote operations.

## 4. Implement install_dependencies with package manager detection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build dependency installation system that auto-detects package managers (pip, npm, yarn, cargo) and installs required packages
### Details:
Create package manager detection logic based on lock files and project structure. Implement installation commands with proper error handling and dependency resolution. Add support for virtual environments and package scopes.

## 5. Create unified interface for different frameworks [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Design and implement a common interface that abstracts framework-specific operations behind a consistent API
### Details:
Build abstraction layer that provides consistent method signatures and return formats across all development tools. Create plugin system for easy framework extension and configuration management.

## 6. Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback systems [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.5
### Description: Implement robust error handling, logging, and user feedback mechanisms across all development tools
### Details:
Create centralized error handling with detailed error messages, recovery suggestions, and logging. Implement progress indicators, success/failure notifications, and interactive prompts for user decisions.
