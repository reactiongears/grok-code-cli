# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement File Operations Tool Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Add comprehensive file operation tools including read_file, list_files, find_files, and grep_files
# Details:
Implement file operation toolset: read_file with line number support and binary file detection, list_files with directory listing and filtering, find_files with pattern matching and search capabilities, grep_files for content search across files. Add proper error handling, validation, file size limits, and safety checks for all operations.

# Architecture Reference:
See tasks/architecture/arch_003.md for detailed implementation guidance.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for each file operation tool, integration tests with various file types, error handling tests for edge cases, performance tests with large files and directories

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement read_file tool with line number support and binary detection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a tool that can read file contents with optional line number display and automatic binary file detection to prevent corrupted output
### Details:
Develop read_file functionality that handles text files with line numbers, detects binary files to avoid display issues, supports encoding detection, and provides proper error handling for file access permissions and non-existent files

## 2. Create list_files tool with directory listing and filtering [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build a tool for listing directory contents with filtering capabilities for file types, hidden files, and directory traversal options
### Details:
Implement directory listing functionality with support for recursive traversal, file type filtering, show/hide hidden files, size information, and proper handling of permission errors and symbolic links

## 3. Build find_files tool with pattern matching capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a file search tool that supports glob patterns, regular expressions, and various search criteria for locating files across the filesystem
### Details:
Create find functionality supporting glob patterns, regex matching, file size filters, modification date ranges, and efficient search algorithms while respecting system permissions and handling large directory structures

## 4. Develop grep_files tool for content search [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Implement a content search tool that can search for patterns within files, supporting regex, case sensitivity options, and result formatting
### Details:
Build grep functionality with regex support, case-insensitive options, context lines, line number reporting, and integration with the read_file tool for consistent file handling and binary detection

## 5. Add comprehensive error handling and safety checks for all file operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Implement robust error handling, security checks, and safety measures across all file operation tools to prevent unauthorized access and system damage
### Details:
Develop comprehensive error handling for permission denied, file not found, disk space issues, path traversal attacks, symlink handling, and implement safety checks to prevent access to sensitive system files and directories
