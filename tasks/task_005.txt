# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Network and System Tools
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add network and system operation tools including HTTP requests, system information, and process management
# Details:
Implement system toolset: http_request for API calls with proper authentication and error handling, system_info for environment and system details, process_management for process listing and control, environment_variables for env var management. Include proper security controls and validation for all system operations.

# Architecture Reference:
See tasks/architecture/arch_005.md for detailed implementation guidance.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for each system tool, integration tests with real APIs and system calls, security validation for system operations, error handling tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement HTTP Request Tool [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a robust HTTP request tool with authentication support, comprehensive error handling, and request/response validation
### Details:
Build http_request tool that supports multiple HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), handles various authentication schemes (Bearer tokens, API keys, basic auth), implements proper timeout handling, SSL verification, and structured error responses with status codes and messages

## 2. Create System Information Tool [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a system_info tool that gathers comprehensive environment and system details across different operating systems
### Details:
Implement cross-platform system information gathering including OS version, hardware specs, environment variables, network configuration, disk usage, memory usage, and running processes while ensuring compatibility with Windows, macOS, and Linux

## 3. Build Process Management Tool [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Implement process_management tool for listing, monitoring, and controlling system processes with proper permissions
### Details:
Create functionality to list running processes with details (PID, name, CPU/memory usage), start/stop processes safely, monitor process status, and handle process signals while implementing proper permission checks and security validations

## 4. Implement Environment Variables Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Build environment_variables tool for reading, setting, and managing environment variables with validation and security controls
### Details:
Develop secure environment variable management that can read system and user environment variables, set temporary variables for process scope, validate variable names and values, and prevent access to sensitive system variables with proper sanitization

## 5. Add Security Controls and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Implement comprehensive security controls, input validation, and safety measures for all system operation tools
### Details:
Add security layer with input sanitization, command injection prevention, privilege escalation protection, audit logging, rate limiting, and comprehensive validation for all system tools to ensure safe operation in production environments
