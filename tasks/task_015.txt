# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Phased Rollout and Deployment System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: low
# Description: Create phased rollout deployment system with early access program, feature flags, and release management
# Details:
Develop deployment system supporting phased rollouts over 12 weeks: early access program functionality, feature flags for controlled feature releases, user segmentation for early access participants, rollback capabilities, monitoring dashboards for rollout progress, user adoption metrics tracking, and automated release management.

# Architecture Reference:
See tasks/architecture/arch_015.md for detailed implementation guidance.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for feature flag logic, integration tests for rollout phases, end-to-end tests for early access program enrollment, load testing for gradual user onboarding, and rollback procedure validation
