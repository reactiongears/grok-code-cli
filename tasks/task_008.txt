# Task ID: 8
# Title: Design and Implement Plugin Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Create extensible plugin system for custom tools with plugin discovery, loading, and management capabilities
# Details:
Design plugin architecture: plugin discovery and loading system, plugin API specification, plugin management CLI commands (install, uninstall, list, enable, disable), plugin development documentation and templates, plugin sandboxing for security, and plugin marketplace integration preparation.

# Architecture Reference:
See tasks/architecture/arch_008.md for detailed implementation guidance.

# Test Strategy:
Plugin loading and discovery tests, plugin API validation, plugin management command testing, security isolation testing, documentation completeness validation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design plugin architecture and API specification [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the plugin system architecture, create API specifications for plugin interfaces, and establish plugin lifecycle management patterns
### Details:
Design plugin interface contracts, define plugin metadata structure, establish communication protocols between plugins and core system, and create plugin lifecycle hooks (load, initialize, execute, cleanup)

## 2. Implement plugin discovery and loading system [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Build the core plugin discovery mechanism and dynamic loading infrastructure to locate and instantiate plugins at runtime
### Details:
Create plugin registry system, implement plugin scanning from designated directories, build dynamic module loading with error handling, and establish plugin dependency resolution

## 3. Create plugin management CLI commands [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Develop CLI commands for plugin operations including install, uninstall, list, enable, and disable functionality
### Details:
Implement slash commands for plugin management, create plugin installation from remote sources, build plugin state persistence, and add plugin configuration management

## 4. Build plugin sandboxing for security [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Implement security measures to isolate plugins and prevent malicious code execution while maintaining necessary functionality
### Details:
Create restricted execution environments for plugins, implement permission-based access controls, establish resource limits and monitoring, and build plugin signature verification

## 5. Create plugin development documentation and templates [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop comprehensive documentation for plugin developers including API references, templates, and best practices
### Details:
Write plugin development guide, create starter templates for common plugin types, document API endpoints and hooks, and provide example implementations

## 6. Implement plugin validation and testing framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4, 8.5
### Description: Build automated validation system for plugin integrity, compatibility testing, and quality assurance mechanisms
### Details:
Create plugin validation pipeline, implement compatibility checking against API versions, build automated testing framework for plugins, and establish plugin quality metrics

## 7. Prepare plugin marketplace integration foundation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.6
### Description: Establish the foundational infrastructure for plugin marketplace integration including metadata standards and distribution mechanisms
### Details:
Define plugin marketplace metadata schema, implement plugin packaging and distribution formats, create plugin authentication and signing infrastructure, and build marketplace API integration points
