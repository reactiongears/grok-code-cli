# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Monitoring and Metrics System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build monitoring system to track technical metrics, user experience metrics, and system health with automated alerting
# Details:
Create monitoring dashboard and automated alerting for: zero critical security vulnerabilities tracking, 95%+ uptime monitoring, sub-second response time measurement, 90%+ test coverage reporting, workflow completion tracking, user feedback collection system, development task timing analytics, health checks, performance profiling, and user analytics integration.

# Architecture Reference:
See tasks/architecture/arch_013.md for detailed implementation guidance.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for monitoring components, integration tests for metrics collection, load testing for performance thresholds, security scanning automation, and end-to-end workflow testing with timing validation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Metrics Collection Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement core metrics collection system to gather performance data, system metrics, and application statistics
