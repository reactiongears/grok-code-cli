# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement External Dependencies Health Check System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create system to monitor and validate external dependencies including xAI API, VS Code, system tools, and network connectivity
# Details:
Build health check system that validates external dependencies before operations: xAI API connectivity and authentication checks, VS Code installation verification for diff functionality, system tools availability validation, network connectivity testing for remote operations, graceful degradation when dependencies are unavailable, and clear error messages for users.

# Architecture Reference:
See tasks/architecture/arch_014.md for detailed implementation guidance.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for each dependency checker, integration tests with mock failures, manual testing with actual dependency unavailability scenarios

# Subtasks:
## 1. API Connectivity Validators [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement health checks to validate connectivity to the xAI Grok API endpoint
### Details:
Create functions to test API authentication, endpoint availability, and response validation. Include timeout handling and error categorization for different failure types.

## 2. System Tool Detection Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop mechanisms to detect and validate availability of system tools and dependencies
### Details:
Check for required system tools like bash, available MCP servers, file system permissions, and Python environment dependencies. Provide clear feedback on missing components.

## 3. Network Connectivity Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement network connectivity tests for external dependencies and MCP servers
### Details:
Create network tests for internet connectivity, MCP server availability, and external resource access. Include DNS resolution checks and proxy handling.

## 4. Graceful Degradation Handlers [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3
### Description: Implement graceful degradation logic when health checks fail
### Details:
Create fallback mechanisms and user-friendly error messages when health checks fail. Implement partial functionality modes and recovery suggestions based on specific failure patterns.
