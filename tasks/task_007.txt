# Task ID: 7
# Title: Improve Configuration Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance configuration system with validation, schema support, migration capabilities, and environment-specific settings
# Details:
Upgrade configuration management: implement configuration validation with JSON schema, add configuration migration system for version upgrades, support environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, prod), add more granular configuration options, implement configuration backup and restore, and provide configuration validation CLI commands.

# Architecture Reference:
See tasks/architecture/arch_007.md for detailed implementation guidance.

# Test Strategy:
Configuration validation tests, migration testing between versions, environment-specific configuration validation, backup/restore functionality testing

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement configuration validation with JSON schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create JSON schema definitions for user and project configuration files and implement validation logic to ensure configuration integrity
### Details:
Define JSON schemas for settings.json structure, implement validation functions in config.py, add error handling for invalid configurations, and create unit tests for validation logic

## 2. Add configuration migration system for version upgrades [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement automatic configuration migration to handle updates between different versions of the configuration schema
### Details:
Create migration scripts for configuration versions, implement version tracking in config files, add backward compatibility checks, and handle graceful upgrades of existing configurations

## 3. Support environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, prod) [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Add support for environment-specific configuration overrides and management
### Details:
Implement environment detection and configuration layering, create environment-specific settings files, add environment switching commands, and update configuration loading logic to support multiple environments

## 4. Implement configuration backup, restore, and validation CLI commands [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Create CLI commands for backing up, restoring, and validating configuration files
### Details:
Add slash commands for /config backup, /config restore, /config validate, implement backup file management, create restore confirmation prompts, and add configuration health checks
