# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Security Framework
# Status: in_progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct security audit and implement robust security controls including input validation, command sanitization, and permission enforcement
# Details:
Execute comprehensive security audit covering authentication, command execution, input validation, and file system access. Implement security measures: input sanitization for all user inputs, command whitelist/blacklist validation, secure file path handling to prevent directory traversal, API key protection, rate limiting, enhanced permission system with granular controls, and security auditing/logging for privileged operations.

# Architecture Reference:
See tasks/architecture/arch_002.md for detailed implementation guidance.

# Test Strategy:
Security testing with malicious inputs, penetration testing for command injection, validation of permission controls, automated security scanning, and security compliance verification

# Subtasks:
## 1. Conduct security audit and threat assessment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform comprehensive security analysis of the Grok CLI codebase to identify vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and security gaps in current implementation
### Details:
Review code for common security issues like command injection, path traversal, insecure API handling, and privilege escalation. Document findings and prioritize remediation efforts.

## 2. Implement input sanitization framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create robust input validation and sanitization system for all user inputs, commands, and API parameters
### Details:
Develop functions to sanitize user prompts, file paths, command arguments, and configuration values. Implement encoding/escaping mechanisms and input length limits.

## 3. Create command validation and whitelist/blacklist system [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Implement comprehensive command filtering system with configurable whitelist/blacklist for bash commands and tool execution
### Details:
Extend existing permission system with pattern matching, regex-based filtering, and context-aware command validation. Include dangerous command detection and blocking.

## 4. Implement secure file path handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Create secure file operations with path traversal prevention, access control, and sandbox restrictions
### Details:
Implement path canonicalization, directory traversal prevention, file permission checks, and restricted file access zones. Prevent access to sensitive system files.

## 5. Add API key protection mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Implement secure storage, transmission, and handling of API keys and authentication tokens
### Details:
Add encryption for stored credentials, secure memory handling, token rotation capabilities, and prevent API key exposure in logs or error messages.

## 6. Implement rate limiting system [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create rate limiting mechanisms to prevent abuse and protect against DoS attacks
### Details:
Implement request throttling for API calls, command execution limits, and resource usage controls. Add configurable rate limits and cooldown periods.

## 7. Create enhanced permission system with granular controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Develop advanced permission framework with role-based access control and fine-grained security policies
### Details:
Extend current permission system with user roles, resource-specific permissions, time-based access controls, and audit trails for permission changes.

## 8. Add security auditing and logging framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7
### Description: Implement comprehensive security logging, monitoring, and alerting system for suspicious activities
### Details:
Create secure logging mechanisms, anomaly detection, security event correlation, and alerting system. Ensure logs don't contain sensitive information.
