# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Project Intelligence Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Add project context understanding, automatic project type detection, and intelligent code recommendations
# Details:
Implement project intelligence: automatic project type detection based on files and structure, project context understanding for better recommendations, smart file recommendations based on current task, code analysis and insights, dependency analysis and suggestions, and project health monitoring.

# Architecture Reference:
See tasks/architecture/arch_010.md for detailed implementation guidance.

# Test Strategy:
Project type detection accuracy testing, context understanding validation, recommendation quality assessment, code analysis accuracy verification

# Subtasks:
## 1. File-based Project Type Detection Algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement algorithm to automatically detect project type based on file patterns, directory structure, and configuration files
### Details:
Create detection logic for common project types (Python, JavaScript/Node.js, Java, C#, Go, Rust, etc.) by analyzing presence of specific files like package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, Cargo.toml, .gitignore patterns, and directory structures

## 2. Context Analysis Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Build engine to analyze project context including codebase size, complexity metrics, and architectural patterns
### Details:
Develop system to analyze code metrics such as lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, file count, directory depth, import/dependency patterns, and identify architectural patterns like MVC, microservices, monolith structures

## 3. Recommendation System Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Create intelligent recommendation system that suggests tools, best practices, and configurations based on project analysis
### Details:
Implement recommendation engine that suggests appropriate development tools, linting configurations, testing frameworks, CI/CD pipelines, and development practices based on detected project type and context analysis

## 4. Code Analysis Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Integrate static code analysis tools and create unified analysis pipeline for multiple programming languages
### Details:
Integrate language-specific static analysis tools (pylint, ESLint, SonarQube, etc.) and create abstraction layer to provide unified code quality metrics, security vulnerability detection, and code smell identification

## 5. Dependency Graph Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.4
### Description: Build system to analyze and visualize project dependencies, identify potential issues and optimization opportunities
### Details:
Create dependency graph analyzer that maps internal and external dependencies, identifies circular dependencies, outdated packages, security vulnerabilities, and suggests dependency optimization strategies

## 6. Health Monitoring Metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.4, 10.5
### Description: Implement comprehensive project health monitoring system with key performance indicators and trend analysis
### Details:
Develop health monitoring dashboard that tracks code quality trends, dependency health, test coverage, build success rates, and provides actionable insights for maintaining project health over time

## 7. Machine Learning Model Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3, 10.6
### Description: Integrate ML models for advanced pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and predictive project insights
### Details:
Implement machine learning components for advanced project analysis including code pattern recognition, anomaly detection in project metrics, predictive modeling for project maintenance needs, and continuous improvement of recommendation accuracy
