# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Error Handling and Logging Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive error handling framework with centralized logging, user-friendly error messages, and retry mechanisms
# Details:
Implement centralized error handling framework: structured logging with different log levels, user-friendly error message formatting, retry mechanisms for transient failures, error recovery strategies, debugging capabilities with stack traces for developers, and error reporting system for tracking issues.

# Architecture Reference:
See tasks/architecture/arch_006.md for detailed implementation guidance.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for error handling scenarios, integration tests with forced failures, logging output validation, retry mechanism testing, user experience testing for error messages

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement centralized error handling framework with structured logging [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive error handling framework that captures, categorizes, and logs errors in a structured format across the entire application
### Details:
Implement error classes hierarchy, centralized error handler, structured logging with different log levels, error categorization system, and integration points for all components

## 2. Create user-friendly error message formatting system [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop a system to translate technical errors into clear, actionable messages for end users with appropriate context and guidance
### Details:
Design error message templates, implement message formatting logic, create context-aware error descriptions, and establish user guidance for common error scenarios

## 3. Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures with recovery strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Build automatic retry logic for recoverable errors with exponential backoff, circuit breaker patterns, and intelligent failure detection
### Details:
Implement retry decorators, exponential backoff algorithms, circuit breaker implementation, transient error detection, and recovery strategy selection based on error types

## 4. Add debugging capabilities and error reporting system [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Create comprehensive debugging tools and automated error reporting mechanisms to help with troubleshooting and system monitoring
### Details:
Implement debug mode with detailed error traces, error reporting to external systems, error analytics dashboard, stack trace capture and analysis, and integration with monitoring systems
