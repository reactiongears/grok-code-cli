# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Conversation Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Add conversation persistence, history management, context optimization, and multi-conversation support
# Details:
Implement conversation features: conversation persistence across sessions using local storage, conversation history with search capabilities, context management and optimization to handle token limits, multi-conversation support with session switching, conversation export/import functionality, and conversation analytics for usage insights.

# Architecture Reference:
See tasks/architecture/arch_009.md for detailed implementation guidance.

# Test Strategy:
Conversation persistence tests, history search functionality validation, context optimization effectiveness testing, multi-session management testing

# Subtasks:
## 1. Local Storage Persistence Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement local storage system to persist conversation history across sessions

## 4. Multi-Session Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Implement system to handle multiple concurrent conversation sessions
### Details:
Build session management with unique identifiers, session switching capabilities, and isolation between different conversation contexts

## 5. Export/Import Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.4
### Description: Create features to export and import conversation data
### Details:
Implement export to various formats (JSON, text, markdown) and import functionality to restore conversations from backup files with data integrity validation

## 6. Analytics Tracking System [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.4
### Description: Build analytics system to track conversation metrics and usage patterns
### Details:
Create analytics dashboard showing conversation statistics, token usage, session duration, and user interaction patterns with privacy-conscious data collection
