# Grok CLI

An open-source command-line interface for xAI's Grok LLM, designed to replicate the functionality and user experience of Claude Code CLI.

## üìã Project Intention

This project aims to create a comprehensive, secure, and feature-rich CLI tool that provides Claude Code-like functionality using xAI's Grok API. The goal is to offer developers a powerful AI assistant for coding tasks, file operations, and development workflows with the same level of reliability and security as industry-leading tools.

**Key Objectives:**
- **Feature Parity**: Match Claude Code CLI's core functionality and user experience
- **Security First**: Implement robust security controls and input validation
- **Developer Experience**: Provide intuitive tools for common development workflows
- **Extensibility**: Support plugins and custom integrations
- **Cross-Platform**: Work seamlessly across Windows, macOS, and Linux
