3. **Feature Parity**: Add missing core tools and capabilities
4. **Architecture**: Improve code organization and error handling
5. **User Experience**: Enhance usability and developer workflow integration

## Current State Analysis

### Critical Issues (Blocking)
- Missing imports causing runtime failures
- Security vulnerabilities in command execution
- Incomplete tool ecosystem
- Poor error handling throughout

### Success Metrics
- Zero runtime import errors
- Comprehensive security audit pass
- Feature parity with Claude Code CLI core functionality
- 90%+ test coverage for new features

#### R2.2: File System Security
**Priority**: P0 - Security Critical

**Current Risk**:
- `tools.py:52-75` allows overwriting any file without path validation
- No protection against directory traversal attacks

**Requirements**:
- Implement file path validation and sanitization
- Restrict file operations to project directory
- Add file backup before modifications
- Implement file permission checking

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- File paths validated and sanitized
- Operations restricted to safe directories

- `grep_files` - Content search across files

**Requirements**:
- Implement comprehensive file operation toolset
- Add proper error handling and validation
- Support for binary file detection
- Implement file size limits and safety checks

#### R3.2: Development Tools
**Priority**: P1 - High Impact

**Missing Tools**:
- `run_tests` - Test execution with framework detection
- `lint_code` - Code linting and formatting
- `git_operations` - Git status, diff, commit, push
- `install_dependencies` - Package manager operations

**Requirements**:
- Auto-detect project type and tools
- Provide unified interface for different frameworks
- Add proper error handling and user feedback
- Support for popular development workflows

#### R3.3: Network and System Tools
**Priority**: P1 - Medium Impact

**Missing Tools**:
- `http_request` - HTTP client for API calls
- `system_info` - System and environment information
- `process_management` - Process listing and management
- `environment_variables` - Environment variable management

### Phase 4: Architecture Improvements (P2)

#### R4.1: Error Handling Framework
